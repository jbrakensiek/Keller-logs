# Keller-log
Logs for Keller's conjecture experiments

`[three|four]/X/X_Y_0_[three|four]_[gen|solve|check].log`

`three` corresponds to G_7,3; `four` corresponds to G_7,4

`X Y` is the case/subcase

`gen` are the cubes that are added for that particular case

`solve` is the log of the CaDiCaL solver

`check` is the log of DRAT-trim
